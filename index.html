            The Green Book was a famous book that notified African Americans of
            dangerous cities not to visit during their trips. I considered
            building a website to inform people of hotspots for human
            trafficking. The plan is for people to report human trafficking in
            places like gas stations, stores, and hotels. The information can
            save people's lives.

          <h1>What Is Human Trafficking?</h1>
          <h3>
            Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to
            obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Every year,
            millions of men, women, and children are trafficked worldwide â€“
            including right here in the United States. It can happen in any
            community and victims can be any age, race, gender, or nationality.
            Traffickers might use the following methods to lure victims into
            trafficking situations: Violence Manipulation False promises of
            well-paying jobs Romantic relationships
